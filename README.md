# Everyone Chief üç≥

We designed a small web project designed for families to organize daily meals.  
The main idea is simple: each meal has one or more chiefs who cook, and the rest of the family members can choose dishes.  

## Features (planned)
- Family accounts: members can join and stay connected as one group  
- Assign a "chief" for each meal, while others only need to select dishes  
- A collection of common Chinese home-style recipes with ingredients and instructions  
- Simple meal management features, such as who cooked most often  

## Goals
This project is meant to be both useful for my family and a way for me to practice building a real-world web application.  
I plan to start with a basic structure and add features step by step.  

## Next Steps
- [ ] Set up project structure and basic UI  
- [ ] Implement family login and user accounts  
- [ ] Add dish selection and recipe details  
- [ ] Improve design and user experience
